Setting up Samba on Linux Lite
In this scenario, we want our Windows XP machine to be able to access our Linux Lite shares.

1. Open a terminal:

Code:
sudo apt-get purge samba
sudo rm -rf /etc/samba/ /etc/default/samba
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common

sudo smbpasswd -a jerry

where jerry is your login name for Linux Lite. Enter your password twice.
Then do:

sudo leafpad /etc/samba/smbusers

The file will be empty, copy the following into it:

Code:
<jerry> = “<jerry>”

where jerry is your Linux Lite username.

2.
Code:
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
sudo rm /etc/samba/smb.conf
sudo touch /etc/samba/smb.conf
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Add this, in your smb.conf file:

Code:
#======================= Global Settings ====================================
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Linux Lite Shares
netbios name = lappy
security = user
encrypt passwords = true
username map = /etc/samba/smbusers
map to guest = bad user
guest account = nobody
dns proxy = no
#======================= Share Definitions ===================================
[linuxliteshare]
path = /home/%U/Downloads
available = yes
valid users = %U %G
write list = %U
browsable = yes
public = no
writable = yes
guest ok = no
read only = no
printable = no
locking = no
strict locking = no

Ctrl +O enter, Ctrl + X to save the file.

NB: workgroup must equal the workgroup the XP machine is on.
netbios name is the name of the Linux Lite computer, example in a terminal where you see,

Code:
user@lappy:~$

lappy is the netbios name.
path = the path to your share folder on Linux Lite that we want Windows to see eg. /home/jerry/Downloads

Now we need to restart samba.

Code:
sudo service smbd restart
sudo service nmbd restart

3. On your XP machine, explore My Network Places, in the address bar type in the ip address of the Linux Lite machine eg.

Code:
\\10.42.0.68

If all went to plan, you should be in.

You can now read and write to that folder.

To access a share on the XP machine:

1. Open up Thunar, type the ip address in the address bar of Thunar of the XP machine in this format:

Code:
smb://10.42.0.55

Where the ip address is the ip address of the XP machine. Assuming of course you have already set up a folder share on the XP machine.
